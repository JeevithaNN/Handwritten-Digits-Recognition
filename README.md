This project focuses on handwritten digit recognition, which aims to automatically identify digits (0–9) despite variations in individual handwriting styles. The model is trained and evaluated using the MNIST dataset, containing thousands of labeled digit images. Multiple models, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), were implemented and compared. The results show that CNN achieves the highest accuracy, making it highly effective for image-based digit classification tasks used in banking, postal services, and document digitization.
